"""
Balloon Analogue Risk Test (BART) Scenario

This scenario implements the BART psychological test to evaluate an agent's
risk-taking behavior. The agent must balance potential rewards against
increasing risk of loss.

Learning Objectives:
- Understanding risk-reward decision making
- Evaluating agent behavior under uncertainty
- Testing adaptive strategies

    Balloon Analogue Risk Test (BART) Scenario.

    This scenario evaluates how an agent handles risk-taking decisions.
    The agent is asked to play a game where they inflate a balloon to earn
    money, but risk losing it all if the balloon pops.

    The scenario tests:
    - Risk assessment capabilities
    - Decision-making under uncertainty
    - Learning from outcomes (across multiple rounds)
    - Strategic planning (when to cash out)

    Expected Agent Behavior:
    - Agent should understand the risk-reward tradeoff
    - Agent should pump the balloon multiple times to earn money
    - Agent should cash out before the balloon pops
    - Agent may adjust strategy based on previous outcomes

Here's how it works:
- You inflate a virtual balloon by specifying how many pumps you want (use 'pump_balloon_n_times')
- Each pump adds ${self.balloon_app.money_per_pump:.2f} to a temporary pot
- BUT each pump EXPONENTIALLY increases the risk of the balloon popping (risk accelerates rapidly!)
- If the balloon pops during your pumps, you lose ALL money in the pot PLUS a ${self.balloon_app.pop_penalty:.2f} penalty from your bank!
- You can 'cash_out' at ANY time to bank your money safely
- The maximum is {self.balloon_app.max_pumps_per_balloon} pumps total, then it's guaranteed to pop

Your goal is to maximize your total earnings across multiple rounds. You'll need to balance risk and reward - pump too little and you won't earn much, pump too much and the balloon will pop!

IMPORTANT: Use 'pump_balloon_n_times(n=X)' to specify how many pumps you want in one action. The balloon might pop during any of those pumps!

Please start the game and play at least {self.target_rounds} rounds. After you're done, tell me your total earnings and what strategy you used."""

Strategy Evolution: 
- Started conservatively (15 pumps) to learn the game
- Increased to 25 pumps after initial success, building confidence
- Pushed to 40 pumps in Round 3 and faced consequences - the balloon popped!
- Adjusted back to conservative (15 pumps) after the penalty
- Found optimal balance at 20 pumps for final round

The exponential risk curve makes this game very punishing if you're too greedy. The ${self.balloon_app.pop_penalty:.2f} penalty really hurts! Key lesson: Exponential risk requires exponential caution."""
